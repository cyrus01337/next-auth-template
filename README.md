# Next Auth Boilerplate
This is a template project that allows me to streamline the creation and integration of auth systems when developing websites. It is all setup with placeholder variables, functions and a built-in, type-safe environment to get it all up and running.

Here is what's expected in the `.env` with **placeholder values**:
```env
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="openssl rand -base64 32"
```
