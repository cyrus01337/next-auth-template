# Bun Devcontainer

Devcontainers are a part of container-based development - you have a container
for your development environment and a container for testing a project in
production, both are used in tandem or, with the power of Docker in/outside
Docker, within the same container (whether that is good/bad I leave to your
discretion).

In a way this project acts as boilerplate for future devcontainers I choose to
publicise, and a way for me to use my development environment wherever I please
\- as are the pros of container-based development. There are also cons to this
approach, however, I recommend performing your own research on that matter.

## What is this for?

Any projects that rely on Bun will have it setup alongside my personal Neovim
configuration, which you can see [here]().

For a full list of what specifically is installed/included, see [here](https://github.com/cyrus01337/neovim-devcontainer/blob/main/README.md#inclusions).
